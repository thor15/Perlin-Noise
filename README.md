# Perlin Noise

Perlin noise is a mathematical function used to create more realistic images.

# Using Perlin Noise

Changing the frequency, frequency multiplier, amplitude, and amplitude multiplier will change the image that is outputed. A few of the functions have another input called layers which will also change the ouput.
```java
//generateFractalSum(frequency, frequency multiplier, amplitude, amplitude multiplier, layers);
generateFractalSum(.08f, 3.5f, 2, 0.5f, 5);
```
